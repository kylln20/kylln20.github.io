                    Cooking With MAGEON was a game made by me and Angelina Jiang. The problem we were trying to solve was the issue of unhealthy eating. Planning, shopping, cooking, every single day, all while keeping a low budget, seemed like a very difficult endeavor. So our game was made to give at least a bit of experience to people on the difficulties, but also the fun, of cooking for oneself.

                    While our skillsets are somewhat similar, we were still able to divide tasks based on our skillsets. For me, this meant drawing many of the assets that we used in the game, from the backgrounds to the 30x30 pixel pictures of the food items. Aside from that, we both worked on the code together, assisting in debugging and bouncing ideas off of one another.<br>
