                    Cooking With MAGEON was a game made by me and Angelina Jiang. The problem we were trying to solve was the issue of unhealthy eating. Planning, shopping, cooking, every single day, all while keeping a low budget, seemed like a very difficult endeavor. So our game was made to give at least a bit of experience to people on the difficulties, but also the fun, of cooking for oneself.

                    While our skillsets are somewhat similar, we were still able to divide tasks based on our skillsets. For me, this meant drawing many of the assets that we used in the game, from the backgrounds to the 30x30 pixel pictures of the food items. Aside from that, we both worked on the code together, assisting in debugging and bouncing ideas off of one another.<br>

                    Following the requirements of the ISP, the first stage of the game is a tutorial. Here, we let the user get familiar with the interface, introducing them to our mascot, MAGEON, and the goal of the game, for the player to feed themself. The user progresses through the dialogue, as shown here, by pressing &gt;ENTER&lt;

                    Stage 2 is a maze, which we choose to turn into a grocery store. The maze was made with a 3D array, determining the coordinates of each square, and the walls that exist at that square. The player is first presented with difficulty here, having to think about what meals they could possibly make once they get home. The player also has to be mindful of their budget, which depending on the level one chooses to play at (1, 2, 3 corresponding to easy, medium, and difficult respectively), may be more or less.

                    The last part, due to miscommunication, was rather difficult to create. While there could be some more complexity added, I think the concept was good, and that it was executed properly. In this stage, the player navigates the kitchen using arrow keys (or WASD). Using the foods they purchased in the grocery store maze, the player now has to figure out whether the foods they bought are enough to feed them for a day. This is the culmination of our culminating, where all the individual pieces of user interaction and purchasing and the food class mentioned paragraphs ago comes into play.
