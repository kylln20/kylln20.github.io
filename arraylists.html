        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <div class = "text">
            <p>
                Arraylists, as the name suggests, are similar to arrays. There are some key differences though.<br>
                Unlike arrays, arraylists have a DYNAMIC memory space. This means: one can change the number of values stored in the array, removing and adding “spaces”, or indexes instead of just changing existing values. While this does lead arraylists to take longer time to process, they can also be more convenient.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The number of "spaces" in an array is called the <strong>capacity</strong> of the arraylist</li>
                    <li>The number of filled spaces in an arraylist is called the <strong>size</strong> of the arraylist</li>
                </ul>
                The elements stored in an arraylist must be OBJECTS, or not primitive data types. So arraylists cannot be declared to store int, float, or boolean type values, among other data types. Thankfully, for each of these data types, Java has object classes that can be automatically converted into these primitive data types.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>int can be converted to and converted from the Integer class</li>
                    <li>double can be converted to and converted from the Double class</li>
                    <li>boolean can be converted to and from the Boolean class </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <div class = "text">
            <p>
                ArrayLists are generally initialized as ArrayList<dataType> name = new ArrayList<dataType>(opt. size). Within the brackets, one can specify the starting capacity. If it isn’t specified, then the default capacity is set to 10. When initialized this way, none of the “spaces” within the capacity actually have values. These values are assigned with ArrayList methods, to be mentioned later.<br>

        <h2>Arrays Vs ArrayLists</h2>
        <h3>Similarities</h3>
        <div class = "text">
            Both arraylists and arrays are used to:
            <ul>
                <li>store multiple values, known as elements, under one variable name</li>
                <li>access and change values with indexes/indices that start at 0</li>
                <li>store loop traversable data for convenience (one has to be careful with arraylists, more on that later</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Differences</h3>
        <div class = "text" style = "padding: 1.5%">
            <table style = "width: 100%;">

        <h2>Traversal</h2>
        <div class = "text">
            Since one can remove and add elements to an arraylist, that means it's length as well as the indexes of values can change. This makes using for or for-each loops difficult, since both can't (conveniently) keep track of shifting elements.<br> For and for-each loops can still be used, but (for-each loops especially) should only be used in instances where no elements are being removed.
